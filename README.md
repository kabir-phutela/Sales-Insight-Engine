# Sales Insight Engine

A data-driven project designed to uncover insightful patterns and trends from the historic passenger dataset of the Titanic, leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to extract actionable insights in demographics, survival rates, and ticket class variations.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The Sales Insight Engine enables users and stakeholders to explore the classic Titanic dataset from multiple dimensions. By applying robust EDA methods, data cleaning and visualization, this project:
- Identifies demographic patterns, survival distributions, and ticket class variations.  
- Provides a structured workflow from raw data ingestion through preprocessing, feature exploration, and interactive visualizations.  
- Equips decision-makers with meaningful insights rather than simply a predictive model.

## 📌 Key Features  
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing: handling missing values, recording new features, and preparing data for analysis.  
- Detailed visual analysis using widely-adopted plotting libraries showing relationships among age, gender, class, fare, and survival outcome.  
- Modular Python code enabling repeatable analysis and easy adaptation to similar datasets.  
- Insight-driven commentary attached to each visualization, translating numbers into meaningful narratives.

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Visualization:** Static/interactive plots embedded in notebook  
- **Data:** Titanic dataset (publicly available)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub
